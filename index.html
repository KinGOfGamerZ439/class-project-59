        <h2> My hobby is coding</h2>
            <p>My hobby is coding because I love to code and make games amd apps. Coding is also known as programming. Programming is a rewarding career as well as an engaging hobby for developers. If you keep the approach to programming as a hobby than a job, you will sharpen your skills in a practical way. It can also be a fantastic way to master any new programming language. coding is not hard to learn, but it's also not easy, either, and how difficult a time one has with learning to code will vary across a number of factors. The point is, learning to code isn't impossible; or, it's not as impossible as it might seem when it comes to getting us involved.</p>
